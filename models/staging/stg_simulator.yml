  - name: stg_simulator
    description: The stg_simulator model is a staging table that holds data related
      to simulators. It includes columns for the simulator's primary key, ID,
      name, creation date, last updated date, asset number, location ID, lead
      location ID, destination ID, ILS status, date ready for training,
      simulator type key, simulator type name, aircraft model key, aircraft
      model code, aircraft model name, aircraft model type value, aircraft type
      name, aircraft type description, status key, status name, track lost time,
      simulator group key, simulator group name, simulator group description,
      ship date, owner ID, owner customer ID, owner description, manufacturer
      ID, manufacturer name, change time, stage created datetime, and stage last
      updated datetime. The data is sourced from multiple tables in the Sim2
      database and is inserted into the SimulationsAnalyticsStage database. The
      model also logs the process execution and updates the StageTableLastUpdate
      table with the last updated timestamp.
