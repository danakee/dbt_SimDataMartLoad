models:
  - name: stg_user
    description: The stg_user model is a staging table that holds user data
      extracted from the 'employee2.tblEmployee' source table. The model is
      designed to filter out test users and only include employees with a
      non-zero employee number. The data is then inserted into the
      'SimulationsAnalyticsStage.dbo.StageUser' table. The model also logs the
      process execution details such as the number of rows inserted, deleted,
      and the final row count in the
      'SimulationsAnalyticsLogging.dbo.DBTProcessExecutionLog' table. If the
      process is successful, the 'StageTableLastUpdate' table in the
      'SimulationsAnalyticsLogging.dbo' schema is updated with the current
      timestamp. If the process fails, an error message is raised.
